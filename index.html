            EasyScrape helps you scrapes articles from any website. It's easy to
            use and free. You just need to insert url or a file containing the
            multiple urls or just the keyword (It will search for you and gather
            links! ) and it will scrape them, giving you just the text of the
            articles. We made this tool to help you in your research, homework
            and projects.

                EasyScrape is helpful for all who want to gather text content
                for there research, suppose you need multiple articles for your
                research, previously you need to go to every url, copy your text
                from the website, then paste it into the text file, so it was
                really hard to gather all the text content if there were 100's
                of url's. Now, EasyScrape helps you to gather all the text
                content from the website, you just need to paste the keyword or
                the url list and it will automatically scrape the articles and
                download them.

                Sorry for inconvience, but we are still working on it. Some
                websites are difficult to scrape, and for some websites, our
                scraper is not able to scrape the content. But as we will
                develop further we will definetly find some solutions to this
                problem. In meantime you can make us aware of those url's by
                filling the feedback below.
